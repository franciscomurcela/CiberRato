# Generating and executing C++ agents

---

This folder contains material that helps in executing the agents generated by your compiler.
To use it, you should transfer the generated files to here.

## Sample agent

File `agent.py` represents a sample of an agent, 
doing the same as example `min-01.mus`, but written by hand,
which allows to illustrate the material in this folder

## Run the agent

Bash script `run` allows to launch CiberRato's simulator and Viewer and afterwards to launch the agent.
It assumes the scenario is defined by 3 files, stored in directory `../scenes`, 
whose names have a common prefix:

-  `«prefix».xml` contains simulation parameters;

- `«prefix»-lab.xml` describes walls, beacons and targets;

- `«prefix»-grd.xml` describes the starting grid.

By default `run` assumes scenario `scn-1` and agent `agent`, 
but there are options to change the default.

To see the accepted options, run

~~~
    ./run -h
~~~

To run using default values, run

~~~
    ./run 
~~~
